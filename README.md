# EggFix-1.17

Spigot 1.17 introduced an issue of Zombie Jockeys spawning, laying eggs, and keeping hundreds of Zombies from De-Spawning. This can often cause TPS, and performance issues. EggFix fixes that!  
EggFix makes it so eggs cannot be picked up by all mobs (other than players), as well as adding a command to clear existing mobs holding eggs.

## Installation
Simply go to https://github.com/teakivy/EggFix-1.17/releases, download the latest JAR, and add it to your /plugins folder! After the server restarts, the issue should be fixed! (I would reccomend running `/eggfix` to remove all egged-mobs that may have spawned already)

## Commands
`/eggfix` - Removes all loaded mobs holding an egg (besides players)
